3. Removing digits or normalizing numbers
    Depending on your dataset, numbers may not help search much. You might:
    Remove digits entirely
    Convert digits to words
    Normalize formats (e.g., 10% ‚Üí percent)


4. Spelling correction (bonus!)
    If your text has user-generated content, 
    consider spelling correction using libraries like TextBlob or SymSpell.

5. Synonym replacement / word normalization
    Map synonyms to a canonical form, e.g.:
    tshirt, tee, t-shirt ‚Üí tshirt
    jeans, denim pants ‚Üí jeans
    This improves recall during search.
    You can do this via:
    Manual synonym dictionary
    WordNet
    Embedding-based clustering (advanced)

Field-by-Field Analysis and Options:
1. category / sub_category

Recommendation: Index separately (structured fields).

Justification:

These are hierarchical categorical fields.

Users often filter or faceted-search by these.

Merging into unstructured text dilutes their value.

‚úÖ Pros:

Enables faceted navigation.

Supports exact matching / filtering.

High precision for category-based queries.

‚ùå Cons (if merged into text):

Difficult to distinguish "category: shoes" from "shoes" mentioned in description.

Inaccurate relevance scoring.

2. brand

Recommendation: Index separately.

Justification:

Users often filter or search specifically by brand (e.g., "Nike running shoes").

Important for ranking relevance, especially in branded searches.

‚úÖ Pros:

Boosts relevance for brand queries.

Enables filters and brand-based navigation.

‚ùå Cons (if merged into text):

Ambiguity in disambiguating brand name from other mentions.

Hard to boost brand-based queries precisely.

3. seller

Recommendation: Index separately (optional: filterable).

Justification:

Important for filtering, not typically for ranking.

Especially relevant in marketplaces (Amazon, eBay).

‚úÖ Pros:

Enables filtering by seller.

Allows reputation-based ranking or demotion.

‚ùå Cons (if merged into text):

Unnecessary noise in scoring.

Seller name may accidentally affect product relevance.

4. product_details

Recommendation: Merge into a full-text search field (main unstructured content).

Justification:

Contains descriptive text useful for ranking and relevance.

Users query based on features, specifications, and benefits found here.

‚úÖ Pros:

Rich source of text for semantic relevance.

Enables fuzzy matching, keyword expansion, etc.

‚ùå Cons:

May contain noisy or verbose content.

Needs pre-processing (e.g., stop-word removal, stemming, deduplication).

üîÄ Alternative Approaches & Trade-offs:
üîÅ Merging All Fields into a Single Text Field

Pros:

Simpler index structure.

Easier to implement (esp. in basic systems).

Captures all text in one field for retrieval.

Cons:

Loses semantic distinction between fields.

Cannot filter or boost certain fields (e.g., category vs brand).

Poorer relevance control and explainability.

üì¶ Keeping All Fields Separate

Pros:

Maximum control over field-level boosting and scoring.

Enables filtering, faceted search, and personalized ranking.

Cons:

Higher index complexity.

Query formulation becomes more complex (field-aware).
